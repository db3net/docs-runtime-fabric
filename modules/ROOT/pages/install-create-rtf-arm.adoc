The first step to install Anypoint Runtime Fabric is to create a Runtime Fabric using Runtime Manager.

== Before you Begin

Before installing Anypoint Runtime Fabric, review the following topics to ensure that you are ready to install Runtime Fabric:

* xref:architecture.adoc[Runtime Fabric Architecture]
* xref:install-sys-reqs.adoc[Verify System Requirements for Anypoint Runtime Fabric]
* xref:install-port-reqs.adoc[Network Port Requirements for Anypoint Runtime Fabric]

[NOTE]
If you do not see the *Runtime Fabrics* tab in Runtime Manager as described below, contact your customer success manager to enable Anypoint Runtime Fabric for your account.

== Create a Runtime Fabric using Runtime Manager

. From Anypoint Platform, select Runtime Manager.
. Click *Runtime Fabrics*.
. Click *Create Runtime Fabric*.
. Specify the name of your Runtime Fabric.
. Click *Create*.

[NOTE]
After creating the Runtime Fabric, Runtime Manage displays the corresponding activation data. Record this data to be used later when installing the infrastucture.

Runtime Manager initially indicates that the Runtime Fabric is in the activation state. This changes after the Runtime Fabric is installed and connected to Runtime Manager.

== Actions Performed During Installation
 
The `init.sh` script, used in the Runtime Fabric installation process, performs the following operating system configuration changes:

* Overrides the iptable rules.
* Modifies the kernel. How?
* Modifies services, including stops and restarts. What should the user do?

** `firewalld` is permanently killed.
** `iptables.services` is not restarted properly.
* Requires an NTP agent and, by default, attempts to install `chronyd`. This can break other NTP configurations. - what does the user need to do?
* Etc. (This can be supplemented by another NTP client) What does the user need to do?
* Changes made to /etc/resolv.conf after installation are not taken into affect. ?
* Other file modifications?

Understanding the OS configuration actions performed during Runtime Fabric installation helps you better utilize OS configuration management tools for automation and other tasks, for example, automating the steps in this script to manage configuration across multiple VMs. You can auto-generate a secure configuration by the installer using standard RTF configuration variables.
