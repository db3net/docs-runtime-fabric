To configure the pod Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) range on an existing Anypoint Runtime Fabric cluster:

. Create a resource definition using a new `podCIDR` value.
+
In the following example, the yaml file is named `pod-cidr.yaml` and `x.x.x.x/16` represents the new pod CIDR range:
+
```
kind: ClusterConfiguration
version: v1
spec:
  global:
    podCIDR: x.x.x.x/16
```
. Run the following gravity command:
+
```
sudo gravity resource create pod-cidr.yaml --confirm
```
. Monitor the update and wait for the pod CIDR change to be configured on all cluster nodes.

[NOTE]
This operation causes a brief disruption to existing pods and redeploys each node as the 
configuration is applied.
